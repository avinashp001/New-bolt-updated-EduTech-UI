  # Fix Clerk Authentication Integration

  1. Schema Changes
    - Remove foreign key constraint from users table to auth.users
    - Make id field independent (not referencing auth.users)
    - Update RLS policies to work properly with Clerk authentication
    - Remove auth trigger that's not needed for Clerk

  2. Security
    - Update RLS policies to work with clerk_id instead of auth.uid()
    - Ensure proper access control for Clerk-authenticated users
